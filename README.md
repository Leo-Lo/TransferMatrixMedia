# TransferMatrixMedia package
The TransferMatrixMeida package features tools for calculating far-field and near-field optical properties of arbitrary Van de Waals heterostructures using the transfer matrix method. The following optical properties (under p-polarzied or s-polarized light, in both the near-field or far-field regime) can be computed:

-Scatter matrix

-Fresnel coefficients: reflection and transmission

-E field distribution

-H field distribution

-Coulomb kernel
