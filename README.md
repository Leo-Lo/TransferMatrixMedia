# TransferMatrixMedia
The TransferMatrixMeida package features tools for calculating far-field and near-field optical properties of Van de Waals heterostructures using the transfer matrix method. The optical properties (under p-polarzied or s-polarized light, in both the near-field or far-field regime) below can be computed:
-Scatter matrix
-Fresnel coefficients: reflection and transmission
-E field distribution
-H field distribution
-Coulomb kernel
